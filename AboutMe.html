      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I’m Ben, and I’ve lived in Ohio my whole life. After high school I
        attended college to study Media Arts and Animation, however after a
        time I decided to take a hiatus and reevaluate my career plans. As I
        reflected on my past, I decided that I wanted to change course and go
        down another route.</p><br>

      <p>I have had a passion for technology from a young age. I enjoyed doing
        things such as building my own computer, writing simple scripts, and
        troubleshooting my own technical problems. From childhood I wanted to
        work in the game industry and was originally going to school to become
        a 3D modeler. This all lead me to the conclusion that I still wanted
        to work in the game industry but instead wanted to code. Based on this
        I decided that I would go into Information Technology with a focus in
        Game Design and Simulation. Coupled with my knowledge in media arts
        and animation I feel I will be an asset to any company in the gaming
        industry.</p><br>

      <p> have won several awards for my art and photography, including a first
        place in the annual US Congressional Art competition. My winning photograph
        hung in the office of the Speaker of the House in Washington DC for a year.</p><br>

      <h3>Why do you want to be a game programmer?</h3>
